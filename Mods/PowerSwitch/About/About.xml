	<description>This mod adds additional functions to the power switch. 
	
Here you have various research topics available, which will improve the functionality of the switch.
You can research the upgrade for a motion detector, an enemy detector and for a timer.

Description:
- Pawn Detection in Room: Available after research with the normal switch. Detects, if an Pawn (human, animal) is in the room
- Pawn Detection within 7 squares: Available after research. Normal pawn detection mode for wall switches. Normal switches can be switched between this mode and the pawn in room mode by repeatedly pressing the selection button.
- Enemy detection (within 1/2 of the map): Available after research. Available modes: Switch on when detected and switch off when detected.
  Note: Switch ON does not react to mad animals, while Switch OFF does react to mad animals.
- Timer: Switches on and off at specified times. Time is initially set to 6h->On and 20h->Off. This can be changed by pressing the buttons repeatedly
- Hidden power conduits can be researched.
